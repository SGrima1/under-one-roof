<h1> Welcome to Under One Roof </h1>

This is a project that Agata, Georgi, Mollie & Sophia created for their final project at Le Wagon London (batch #474).

The original concept was to create a web app that could be used to offer and book virtual experiences. The experiences would be hosted by people across the globe and would offer a cultural escape to bridge the gap that not being able to travel has left for so many people. 

Under One Roof is coded in Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

We hope you enjoy browsing our code :) 

Rails app generated with [lewagon/rails-templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates), created by the [Le Wagon coding bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com) team.
