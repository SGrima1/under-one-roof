<h1> Welcome to Under One Roof </h1>

This is a project that Agata, Georgi, Mollie & Sophia created for their final project at Le Wagon London (batch #474).

The original concept was to create a web app that could be use to offer and book virtual experiences. The experiences would be offered by hosts worldwide and would offer a cultural escape to bridge the gap that not being able to travel has left for so many people. 

We hope you enjoy browsing our code :) 

Rails app generated with [lewagon/rails-templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates), created by the [Le Wagon coding bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com) team.
